"efficiency and performance by caching frequently-accessed information at the"
" edge of the network. This brings content physically closer to end users, "

"designed to improve content delivery for enterprises, Internet service "
"providers (ISPs), backbone providers, and large intranets by maximizing "
"existing and available bandwidth."
